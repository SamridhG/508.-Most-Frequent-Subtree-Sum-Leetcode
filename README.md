# 508.-Most-Frequent-Subtree-Sum-Leetcode


Given the root of a binary tree, return the most frequent subtree sum. If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.



The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).

Example 1:


Input: root = [5,2,-3]


Output: [2,-3,4]
